CurseInvaders
=============

Space Invaders written in C++ using the ncurses library.

I wrote this because I found when I was learning java that game development was the best way to learn. There are so many different interesting problems that only present themselves in large projects like a game. So this is really just a learning project.

I strongly recommend that nobody tries to use this code as an example because there is a decent chance that I am totally wrong about everything :).
